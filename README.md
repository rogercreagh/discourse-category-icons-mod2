# discourse-category-icons-mod2
 Fork of Category Icons for XRUK

This is based on the [Category Icons](https://meta.discourse.org/t/category-icons-component/104683) theme component. It includes some additional mods to make the colour of the icon match the category colour, and to adjust the layout with the icon replacing the colour bar.

This does not work correctly if the bullet option is used for category layout.
